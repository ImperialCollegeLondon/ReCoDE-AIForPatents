In this notebook, we will cover the foundations of different modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, and employ them for a binary classification task.

Learning Objectives:

- Understand why patents need to be classified

- Learn how to create datasets for Natural Language Processing using web-scraping techniques and pandas.

- Load, analyse, and prepare datasets for use with machine learning models in Tensorflow

- Be able to have a basic understanding of how the following models work in an NLP context, and identify their advantages and drawbacks:


  - Multinomial Bayes with Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
  - MultiLayer Perceptron
  - Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM)
  - Transformers
  - 1D-Convolutional Neural Networks

- Learn how to design training pipelines and model architectures in Tensorflow to train the above models to solve a text binary classification problem.

- Learn how to evaluate and compare the performance of models trained in tensorflow
